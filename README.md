My Final Project

Short Description:

This app is intended for registering new technical spare parts into the company ERP database.

The company standard defines what details should be submitted and in which format, and what needs to be included in the final registration form.

It has 3 main processes:

-   Users:
    -   Registration
    -   Approval (defining user level in the process)
    -   Editing details (by user) or changing user level status (by administrator)
-   Items:
    -   Registration
    -   Approval in 2 stages â€“ 1) By administrator to verify that details have been submitted correctly, 2) By procurement to verify compliance to procurement standard.
-   Final application:
    -   Creates a submission form in a predefined standard format.
